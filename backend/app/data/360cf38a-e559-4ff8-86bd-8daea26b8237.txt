Great choice. But now the big question. 00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 align:start position:0% Great choice. But now the big question. 00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.470 align:start position:0% Great choice. But now the big question. Calisthenics or gym? One has you doing 00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0% Calisthenics or gym? One has you doing 00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.709 align:start position:0% Calisthenics or gym? One has you doing muscleups on a rusty bar at the park 00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 align:start position:0% muscleups on a rusty bar at the park 00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.669 align:start position:0% muscleups on a rusty bar at the park while the dog barks at you? The other 00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0% while the dog barks at you? The other 00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829 align:start position:0% while the dog barks at you? The other has you waiting 20 minutes for a bench 00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 align:start position:0% has you waiting 20 minutes for a bench 00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.910 align:start position:0% has you waiting 20 minutes for a bench because some dude's busy scrolling Tik 00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 align:start position:0% because some dude's busy scrolling Tik 00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.029 align:start position:0% because some dude's busy scrolling Tik Tok. Both can bring you results, but 00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 align:start position:0% Tok. Both can bring you results, but 00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.990 align:start position:0% Tok. Both can bring you results, but which one actually fits you? Let me fix 00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 align:start position:0% which one actually fits you? Let me fix 00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.550 align:start position:0% which one actually fits you? Let me fix that. Before we even start, let's make 00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0% that. Before we even start, let's make 00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.310 align:start position:0% that. Before we even start, let's make sure we're on the same page. 00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0% sure we're on the same page. 00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0% sure we're on the same page. Calisthenics. That's raw primal 00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 align:start position:0% Calisthenics. That's raw primal 00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.110 align:start position:0% Calisthenics. That's raw primal training. Your body is the gym. No 00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0% training. Your body is the gym. No 00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.750 align:start position:0% training. Your body is the gym. No dumbbells, no machines, no fancy 00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0% dumbbells, no machines, no fancy 00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.069 align:start position:0% dumbbells, no machines, no fancy equipment. Just you and gravity duking 00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 align:start position:0% equipment. Just you and gravity duking 00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.150 align:start position:0% equipment. Just you and gravity duking it out. You're pushing, pulling, and 00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 align:start position:0% it out. You're pushing, pulling, and 00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.790 align:start position:0% it out. You're pushing, pulling, and moving like a human machine. Arms, legs, 00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 align:start position:0% moving like a human machine. Arms, legs, 00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.350 align:start position:0% moving like a human machine. Arms, legs, core, all firing together. At the start, 00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 align:start position:0% core, all firing together. At the start, 00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.910 align:start position:0% core, all firing together. At the start, it's the basics. Push-ups, pull-ups, 00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 align:start position:0% it's the basics. Push-ups, pull-ups, 00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.709 align:start position:0% it's the basics. Push-ups, pull-ups, squats, dips. But once you level up, you 00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 align:start position:0% squats, dips. But once you level up, you 00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.950 align:start position:0% squats, dips. But once you level up, you unlock the flashy stuff like plunch, 00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0% unlock the flashy stuff like plunch, 00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.350 align:start position:0% unlock the flashy stuff like plunch, front lever, or muscle-ups. Now, flip 00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 align:start position:0% front lever, or muscle-ups. Now, flip 00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.310 align:start position:0% front lever, or muscle-ups. Now, flip the coin. Weight training. basically the 00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0% the coin. Weight training. basically the 00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.510 align:start position:0% the coin. Weight training. basically the gym life here. It's barbells, dumbbells, 00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 align:start position:0% gym life here. It's barbells, dumbbells, 00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.070 align:start position:0% gym life here. It's barbells, dumbbells, cables, and every shiny machine staring 00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 align:start position:0% cables, and every shiny machine staring 00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0% cables, and every shiny machine staring at you. It's about loading external 00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0% at you. It's about loading external 00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.390 align:start position:0% at you. It's about loading external weight and engineering your body like a 00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 align:start position:0% weight and engineering your body like a 00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.190 align:start position:0% weight and engineering your body like a construction project. Add 5 lbs this 00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:start position:0% construction project. Add 5 lbs this 00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.510 align:start position:0% construction project. Add 5 lbs this week, five more next. You literally 00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 align:start position:0% week, five more next. You literally 00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.990 align:start position:0% week, five more next. You literally watch your muscles grow in real time. 00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 align:start position:0% watch your muscles grow in real time. 00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.789 align:start position:0% watch your muscles grow in real time. Both paths build strength. Both can pack 00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 align:start position:0% Both paths build strength. Both can pack 00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.710 align:start position:0% Both paths build strength. Both can pack on muscle, but they don't give you the 00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0% on muscle, but they don't give you the 00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.109 align:start position:0% on muscle, but they don't give you the same aesthetics or progression. So, the 00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0% same aesthetics or progression. So, the 00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.510 align:start position:0% same aesthetics or progression. So, the real question is, which one should you 00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0% real question is, which one should you 00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.310 align:start position:0% real question is, which one should you pick? Let's break it down. 00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0% 00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.710 align:start position:0% Before we even talk results, let's hit 00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 align:start position:0% Before we even talk results, let's hit 00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.109 align:start position:0% Before we even talk results, let's hit the one thing that makes or breaks most 00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 align:start position:0% the one thing that makes or breaks most 00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.990 align:start position:0% the one thing that makes or breaks most people. Money. Calisthenics basically 00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 align:start position:0% people. Money. Calisthenics basically 00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.749 align:start position:0% people. Money. Calisthenics basically free. Zero memberships, zero machines, 00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0% free. Zero memberships, zero machines, 00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.390 align:start position:0% free. Zero memberships, zero machines, zero excuses. Gravity doesn't charge 00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 align:start position:0% zero excuses. Gravity doesn't charge 00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.870 align:start position:0% zero excuses. Gravity doesn't charge rent. You can train in your room on a 00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 align:start position:0% rent. You can train in your room on a 00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.429 align:start position:0% rent. You can train in your room on a pull-up bar in the park or even a door 00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 align:start position:0% pull-up bar in the park or even a door 00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.830 align:start position:0% pull-up bar in the park or even a door frame if you're feeling creative. Want 00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0% frame if you're feeling creative. Want 00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.069 align:start position:0% frame if you're feeling creative. Want to upgrade? Grab some resistance bands, 00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0% to upgrade? Grab some resistance bands, 00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.389 align:start position:0% to upgrade? Grab some resistance bands, a pull-up bar, maybe some suspension 00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0% a pull-up bar, maybe some suspension 00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.709 align:start position:0% a pull-up bar, maybe some suspension trainer, but that's just extra sauce. 00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 align:start position:0% trainer, but that's just extra sauce. 00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.270 align:start position:0% trainer, but that's just extra sauce. The base game always free. On the other 00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0% The base game always free. On the other 00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.350 align:start position:0% The base game always free. On the other side, the gym is a different story. 00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0% side, the gym is a different story. 00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.190 align:start position:0% side, the gym is a different story. Sure, you can find a cheap gym, but 00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0% Sure, you can find a cheap gym, but 00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.510 align:start position:0% Sure, you can find a cheap gym, but you'll still have to spend at least $40 00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0% you'll still have to spend at least $40 00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.469 align:start position:0% you'll still have to spend at least $40 a month just for access. Fancy gym with 00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 align:start position:0% a month just for access. Fancy gym with 00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.030 align:start position:0% a month just for access. Fancy gym with saunas and smoothies? You're kissing 00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 align:start position:0% saunas and smoothies? You're kissing 00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.750 align:start position:0% saunas and smoothies? You're kissing $100 a month goodbye. Now, don't get me 00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 align:start position:0% $100 a month goodbye. Now, don't get me 00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.229 align:start position:0% $100 a month goodbye. Now, don't get me wrong, a gym membership is an amazing 00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0% wrong, a gym membership is an amazing 00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.630 align:start position:0% wrong, a gym membership is an amazing investment. Just make sure the maximum 00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start position:0% investment. Just make sure the maximum 00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.670 align:start position:0% investment. Just make sure the maximum weight for the dumbbells isn't 20 kg. 00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0% weight for the dumbbells isn't 20 kg. 00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.350 align:start position:0% weight for the dumbbells isn't 20 kg. And if you're thinking about building a 00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0% And if you're thinking about building a 00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.470 align:start position:0% And if you're thinking about building a home gym, barbell plates, squat rack, 00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 align:start position:0% home gym, barbell plates, squat rack, 00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.390 align:start position:0% home gym, barbell plates, squat rack, you're easily a grand deep before you 00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0% you're easily a grand deep before you 00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.790 align:start position:0% you're easily a grand deep before you even curl a dumbbell. So when it comes 00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0% even curl a dumbbell. So when it comes 00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.430 align:start position:0% even curl a dumbbell. So when it comes to finances, calisthenics wipes the 00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 align:start position:0% to finances, calisthenics wipes the 00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.920 align:start position:0% to finances, calisthenics wipes the floor. 00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 align:start position:0% floor. 00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.750 align:start position:0% floor. [Music] 00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0% [Music] 00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.070 align:start position:0% [Music] If the cost is not a big deal for you, 00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0% If the cost is not a big deal for you, 00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.229 align:start position:0% If the cost is not a big deal for you, what about how easy it is to actually 00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0% what about how easy it is to actually 00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.710 align:start position:0% what about how easy it is to actually get started? On paper, calisthenics 00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0% get started? On paper, calisthenics 00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.509 align:start position:0% get started? On paper, calisthenics looks simple. push-ups, pull-ups, dips, 00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0% looks simple. push-ups, pull-ups, dips, 00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0% looks simple. push-ups, pull-ups, dips, no weights, just your body. How hard can 00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0% no weights, just your body. How hard can 00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.949 align:start position:0% no weights, just your body. How hard can it be? Well, most beginners can barely 00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0% it be? Well, most beginners can barely 00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.589 align:start position:0% it be? Well, most beginners can barely knock out five clean push-ups. And 00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0% knock out five clean push-ups. And 00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.910 align:start position:0% knock out five clean push-ups. And pull-ups, forget it. Most can't do a 00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:start position:0% pull-ups, forget it. Most can't do a 00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.830 align:start position:0% pull-ups, forget it. Most can't do a single one. Because the truth is, 00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0% single one. Because the truth is, 00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.910 align:start position:0% single one. Because the truth is, there's no lightweight mode in 00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 align:start position:0% there's no lightweight mode in 00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.390 align:start position:0% there's no lightweight mode in calisthenics. You're lifting your entire 00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0% calisthenics. You're lifting your entire 00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:0% calisthenics. You're lifting your entire body from day one, whether you're 50 kg 00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0% body from day one, whether you're 50 kg 00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.509 align:start position:0% body from day one, whether you're 50 kg or 100. That's like jumping straight 00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0% or 100. That's like jumping straight 00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.750 align:start position:0% or 100. That's like jumping straight into hard mode before you've even 00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0% into hard mode before you've even 00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.750 align:start position:0% into hard mode before you've even touched the tutorial. And that makes 00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0% touched the tutorial. And that makes 00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.149 align:start position:0% touched the tutorial. And that makes progress slow. Your first pull-up can 00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0% progress slow. Your first pull-up can 00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.790 align:start position:0% progress slow. Your first pull-up can take weeks, sometimes months of grind. 00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start position:0% take weeks, sometimes months of grind. 00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.790 align:start position:0% take weeks, sometimes months of grind. Now, compared to the gym, it's basically 00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0% Now, compared to the gym, it's basically 00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.949 align:start position:0% Now, compared to the gym, it's basically beginner heaven. Dumbbells start as 00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0% beginner heaven. Dumbbells start as 00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.070 align:start position:0% beginner heaven.

Calisthenics is functional power at its core. You're not just 00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0% power at its core. You're not just 00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.390 align:start position:0% power at its core. You're not just pumping up your chest to flex in the 00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0% pumping up your chest to flex in the 00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.390 align:start position:0% pumping up your chest to flex in the mirror. You're teaching your body to 00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0% mirror. You're teaching your body to 00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.950 align:start position:0% mirror. You're teaching your body to move like a unit. Core locked, balance 00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0% move like a unit. Core locked, balance 00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.430 align:start position:0% move like a unit. Core locked, balance on point, coordination firing on every 00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0% on point, coordination firing on every 00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.430 align:start position:0% on point, coordination firing on every rep. It makes you feel like an actual 00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0% rep. It makes you feel like an actual 00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.629 align:start position:0% rep.

The 00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.710 align:start position:0% athlete, not just someone who lifts. The gym, though, that's the undisputed king 00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0% gym, though, that's the undisputed king 00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.510 align:start position:0% gym, though, that's the undisputed king of muscle size. Machines and barbells 00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0% of muscle size. Machines and barbells 00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.830 align:start position:0% of muscle size. Machines and barbells let you go way beyond what body weight 00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0% let you go way beyond what body weight 00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.909 align:start position:0% let you go way beyond what body weight alone can do. Especially when it comes 00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0% alone can do. Especially when it comes 00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.390 align:start position:0% alone can do. Especially when it comes to legs. Yeah, pistol squats are cool, 00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0% to legs. Yeah, pistol squats are cool, 00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0% to legs. Yeah, pistol squats are cool, but they'll never hit the same as 00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0% but they'll never hit the same as 00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.150 align:start position:0% but they'll never hit the same as throwing plates on a bar and squatting 00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0% throwing plates on a bar and squatting 00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.150 align:start position:0% throwing plates on a bar and squatting double your body weight, even with a 00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0% double your body weight, even with a 00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.430 align:start position:0% double your body weight, even with a weighted vest. Plus, you get precision. 00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0% weighted vest. Plus, you get precision. 00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.749 align:start position:0% weighted vest.

That's 00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0% hard is it to actually get them? That's 00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.230 align:start position:0% hard is it to actually get them? That's another thing. Weightlifting progression 00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0% another thing. Weightlifting progression 00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.870 align:start position:0% another thing. Weightlifting progression is simple. You lift a weight today, next 00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0% is simple. You lift a weight today, next 00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.189 align:start position:0% is simple. You lift a weight today, next week, add a little more or squeeze out 00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0% week, add a little more or squeeze out 00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.710 align:start position:0% week, add a little more or squeeze out one more rep. Boom. Progress. Stacking 00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0% one more rep. Boom. Progress. Stacking 00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.950 align:start position:0% one more rep. Boom. Progress. Stacking progressive overload is simple and one 00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0% progressive overload is simple and one 00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start position:0% progressive overload is simple and one of the main factors to grow muscle. The 00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0% of the main factors to grow muscle. The 00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.670 align:start position:0% of the main factors to grow muscle. The numbers don't lie. And tracking progress 00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0% numbers don't lie. And tracking progress 00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.710 align:start position:0% numbers don't lie. And tracking progress is as easy as checking your log book. 00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0% is as easy as checking your log book. 00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.950 align:start position:0% is as easy as checking your log book. And with all the machines, dumbbells, 00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0% And with all the machines, dumbbells, 00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.110 align:start position:0% And with all the machines, dumbbells, cables, kettle bells, the list of 00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0% cables, kettle bells, the list of 00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.430 align:start position:0% cables, kettle bells, the list of exercises is almost endless to hit your 00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0% exercises is almost endless to hit your 00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.670 align:start position:0% exercises is almost endless to hit your muscles from every angle. You will find 00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0% muscles from every angle. You will find 00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.070 align:start position:0% muscles from every angle. You will find the moves that click with your body and 00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0% the moves that click with your body and 00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.110 align:start position:0% the moves that click with your body and keep stacking wins. Calisthenics, that's 00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0% keep stacking wins. Calisthenics, that's 00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.270 align:start position:0% keep stacking wins. Calisthenics, that's a whole different type of grind. You 00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0% a whole different type of grind. You 00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.430 align:start position:0% a whole different type of grind. You can't just slap plates on your back. 00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0% can't just slap plates on your back. 00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.670 align:start position:0% can't just slap plates on your back. Progression means leveling up to harder 00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0% Progression means leveling up to harder 00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.710 align:start position:0% Progression means leveling up to harder variations. Regular push-ups. Next level 00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0% variations. Regular push-ups. Next level 00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.950 align:start position:0% variations. Regular push-ups. Next level is archer push-ups, then one arm 00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0% is archer push-ups, then one arm 00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.550 align:start position:0% is archer push-ups, then one arm push-ups. Pull-ups, try muscle-ups. Each 00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0% push-ups. Pull-ups, try muscle-ups. Each 00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.029 align:start position:0% push-ups. Pull-ups, try muscle-ups. Each new step can take months. That can feel 00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0% new step can take months. That can feel 00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.870 align:start position:0% new step can take months. That can feel frustrating if you're chasing fast 00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0% frustrating if you're chasing fast 00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.790 align:start position:0% frustrating if you're chasing fast progress, especially when tracking 00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0% progress, especially when tracking 00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.110 align:start position:0% progress, especially when tracking progress is more complicated. For 00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0% progress is more complicated. For 00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0% progress is more complicated. For long-term use, both keep you challenged, 00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0% long-term use, both keep you challenged, 00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.230 align:start position:0% long-term use, both keep you challenged, just in different ways. But calisthenics 00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0% just in different ways. But calisthenics 00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.790 align:start position:0% just in different ways. But calisthenics makes it harder to track your progress. 00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0% makes it harder to track your progress. 00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.110 align:start position:0% makes it harder to track your progress. If you want progress that's clear, 00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0% If you want progress that's clear, 00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.070 align:start position:0% If you want progress that's clear, simple, and measurable, the gym is the 00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0% simple, and measurable, the gym is the 00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.790 align:start position:0% simple, and measurable, the gym is the fast lane. But if you love the grind of 00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0% fast lane. But if you love the grind of 00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.710 align:start position:0% fast lane. But if you love the grind of skill building and the discipline it 00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0% skill building and the discipline it 00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0% skill building and the discipline it takes, calisthenics offers a long-term 00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0% takes, calisthenics offers a long-term 00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.309 align:start position:0% takes, calisthenics offers a long-term journey like no other. 00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0% 00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0% Let's be real. Most people don't start 00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0% Let's be real. Most people don't start 00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.270 align:start position:0% Let's be real. Most people don't start training to master a plunchch or squat 00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0% training to master a plunchch or squat 00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.110 align:start position:0% training to master a plunchch or squat three plates. They just want to lose 00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0% three plates. They just want to lose 00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.350 align:start position:0% three plates. They just want to lose weight. But here's the truth. If your 00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0% weight. But here's the truth. If your 00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.510 align:start position:0% weight. But here's the truth. If your main goal is fat loss, neither 00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0% main goal is fat loss, neither 00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.830 align:start position:0% main goal is fat loss, neither calisthenics nor the gym alone is going 00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0% calisthenics nor the gym alone is going 00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.070 align:start position:0% calisthenics nor the gym alone is going to save you. The reality is this. 00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0% to save you. The reality is this. 00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.589 align:start position:0% to save you. The reality is this. Whether you're doing push-ups in the 00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0% Whether you're doing push-ups in the 00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.909 align:start position:0% Whether you're doing push-ups in the park or squats under a barbell, there 00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0% park or squats under a barbell, there 00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.230 align:start position:0% park or squats under a barbell, there are way better options to focus on 00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0% are way better options to focus on 00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.309 align:start position:0% are way better options to focus on weight loss. But pair your workouts with 00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0% weight loss. But pair your workouts with 00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.309 align:start position:0% weight loss. But pair your workouts with a proper diet and sprinkle in some 00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0% a proper diet and sprinkle in some 00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.469 align:start position:0% a proper diet and sprinkle in some cardio and you will build strength, 00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0% cardio and you will build strength, 00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.629 align:start position:0% cardio and you will build strength, muscle, and a physique that sticks 00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0% muscle, and a physique that sticks 00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.870 align:start position:0% muscle, and a physique that sticks around after the fat is gone. Saying 00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0% around after the fat is gone. Saying 00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0% around after the fat is gone. Saying that, if you're overweight and just 00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0% that, if you're overweight and just 00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.270 align:start position:0% that, if you're overweight and just starting out, calisthenics can feel like 00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0% starting out, calisthenics can feel like 00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.909 align:start position:0% starting out, calisthenics can feel like a straightup nightmare. A push-up means 00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0% a straightup nightmare. A push-up means 00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.550 align:start position:0% a straightup nightmare. A push-up means pushing your entire body weight. Same 00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0% pushing your entire body weight. Same 00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.510 align:start position:0% pushing your entire body weight. Same goes with pull-ups. 00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0% goes with pull-ups. 00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.510 align:start position:0% goes with pull-ups.

Calisthenics does get an edge when 00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0% all. Calisthenics does get an edge when 00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.150 align:start position:0% all. Calisthenics does get an edge when it comes to mobility. But let's be real, 00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0% it comes to mobility. But let's be real, 00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.310 align:start position:0% it comes to mobility. But let's be real, both calisthenics and weightlifting are 00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0% both calisthenics and weightlifting are 00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.110 align:start position:0% both calisthenics and weightlifting are safe as long as you're not being sloppy. 00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0% safe as long as you're not being sloppy. 00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.670 align:start position:0% safe as long as you're not being sloppy.

That's where injuries happen, not the method itself. If you're 00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0% happen, not the method itself. If you're 00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:39.670 align:start position:0% happen, not the method itself.
