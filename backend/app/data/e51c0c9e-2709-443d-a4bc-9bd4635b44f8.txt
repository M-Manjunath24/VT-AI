Right, let's be honest here, when you're out on a bike ride, your phone is pretty much a lifeline. Navigation, emergency cars, even music, it's all in there. But let's face it, trying to keep your phone safe, accessible, and still look cool. That's where things start getting a bit tricky. What is that? What the hell is even that? So, what I've told you is a product that's not just a phone holder. It's a phone holder, it's some glasses holder, a spare battery holder for your action camera, and just a super handy stylus, sort of pouch for all the stuff you need on a ride. Well, that is exactly what the trip machine navigator is. And in this video, I'm going to take a deep dive into why this thing isn't just a great way to keep your phone on your bike, but actually a game changer for every rider out there. Stick around, I'll cover everything from how it stays put on your bike, to how it holds all your essentials, and of course, how good it looks on something as gorgeous as its interceptor. Might be in a little bit biased there. Fitment. Now, there's the technical bit. This is where most people run into trouble, installing high tech gadgets on their bikes. You need tools, precision, and sometimes a degree in engineering. And there we go. It's that easy. If you can press a button on the microwave, you can definitely fit one of these. No screws, no bolts, no hassle. Just six super strong magnets. These aren't your average fridge magnets. Simple, easy, and solid. And you know what? Once it's on, it's going nowhere. It's got this thing for a ride. It's some rough road, sharp bends, and no wobbling. No slip-in. It's on there like it's part of the bike. First thing you'll notice is how good it looks on the interceptor. It fits the vibe perfectly. This modern retro design combined with the rugged canvas and lever of the navigator just works so well together. Now let's start functioning, Alette. If you wear touch screen gloves or smart gloves, the clip, the tech to screen allows you to use your phone without removing it from the navigator. This is great when I'm the move. I really don't recommend you use your phone while riding them. And here's the clever part. When you're off the bike, you don't have to leave the navigator behind. You can wear it as a funny pack. That's funny. Belt pouch or even sling it over your chest. It's versatile, looks cool. You keep your phone with an easy reach. Let's be honest, you're not going to look at a place where and on your next coffee stop. It's stylish and practical in one neat package. The navigator has plenty of space for the essentials. House keys, wallet, spare batteries, charging cables. You name it. There's even room for an action camera so you can capture a ride about worrying about where to stash it when not riding. So what are the materials like? They are top notch. Heavy duty canvas and premium lever. It's built to last. No flimsy stuff here. This is a solid, road ready companion for your bike. And it'll take whatever you throw at it. And when the weather decides to be a bit unpredictable, the navigator's got a waterproof YKK zipper. So your phone stays dry and no matter what's coming down from the sky. Which is handy for me as I live in England. Rain, rain, rain. Us Brits endure it on 199 days of every year. Did I mention the colours? Because if you're wondering, the navigator comes in a great range of styles to match your vibe. Whether you're into the classic ground in tobacco, sleek or black, rugged green in tobacco, or a fresh blue and tan combo. There's something for everyone. Now let's start a value for a second. For £46 you're not just paying for a phone holder. You're getting a stylish, multi-functional pouch that keeps your gear organized, safe and easily accessible.

For me, the best part about the navigator is when you're not using it, just take it off your bike.
