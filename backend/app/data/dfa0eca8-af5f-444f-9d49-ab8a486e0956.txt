Okay, hold on. Before we start today's video, I want to try something interesting. See, I was reading this about article, how smartphones have changed, about how smartphones have changed our daily routine. Like the average person checks their phone 96 times per day, which means every 10 minutes, we are interrupting whatever we are doing and if you check your phone on this ring right now for a notification, you my friend have this virus. Yes, this virus is not just with our generation. 5 to 6 year old children spending hours on phone scrolling rings and short as they won't keep food. Kids crying because the tablety is taken away, they can't watch Coco Melan. I am not scared to travel on trains because I am tired of hearing that strange laughing sound from YouTube and Instagram rings. And the constant switching between tasks is actually re-riding your neural pathways. Attention span has fallen to a glorious low of 8 seconds. Like we had this rule in editing, we had to cut short export montages every 10 seconds. Now that goes out of the window to 8 seconds. And see, now the video felt better to watch and consume, right? More engaging, less boring. The brain was getting this stimulation, it craved. But here's the scary part, you my friend, you just experienced brain rot in real time. The fact that you needed a cartoon game and background music to focus on basic information, that's not normal. And if you think about it, this manipulation is everywhere. Like, eat WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Zepto, Swiggy, even blink it. They all have these red dots on top of them. And when you see these notification badges, just can't resist yourself. You open the specific app and then the doom scrolling starts. You my friend are going through a disease. In fact, watching this video at 1.5x is also not normal. In fact, if you're still here in the video, you're part of the top 60%. Almost half have already left this video. This is what we call brain rot. In fact, this was the Oxford's dictionary of the world for the year 2024. And it's happening to millions of people worldwide. And you might know at least one of this content. And if you know all of them, that's strange. And the question is, this virus is destroying our youth. How are these apps destroying your focus, your talent, your future. And if you are in the top 10% and watch this video till the end at 1x speed, I'll tell you how can you cure it. My name is Vati. This is T.W. Explains. And let's break it down. Now, before we dive in further, I was reading this book called Hooked by Nereal, who is a psychologist who worked in such a social media company. Now, let me explain how this app clipped the brain with an example. It is a four step model. Like, let's take an example of my father. He worked at 5am. He had mostly nothing to do, but had an inherent trigger to walk or know the world. This is step one. Trigger. And to resolve this trigger, he took action. He just went for a walk or read a newspaper or just played chess for hours. And after hours of reading or walking, he got to feel good factor. That is step three reward. And he kept on doing year on year, year on year. He's 60 now, but fitter. He has really good current affairs knowledge because of reading newspaper. And now, if you pick up this four step model and apply to us, we get up in the morning and our trigger is external. You turn on internet and there is boom notifications. You take an action. You quickly open the app, swipe, scroll, like. The reward is means, likes on your stories, comments on your post. It's so instant. You don't need to spread hours of walking or reading newspaper. Your investment is your meaningful data. Photos uploaded with friends. Your follow account. That's step four. And you notice what took my dad so much time to get rewarded. It is instant for us right on your bed. So why would you exercise? Why would you read? This is your dad's brain. And this is yours. Rotten by the social media apps. And don't think this is a mistake. These apps are targeted. They are designed carefully using neuroscientists so they can hit this part of your brain in three different ways. And now that you've realized that you are also of the brain rot type, when there are three symptoms of brain rot. And the first one will explain exactly what happened to your brain during half an hour. Dopine hijacking. Let me explain what dopamine actually is. It's not the happiness chemical which makes people think they get happy. It's the Dilmange more chemical. Every time you get that notification see a new video or hit that Instagram, your brain releases a small hit of dopamine. Not because you're happy, but because your brain thinks something rewarding is coming. It is the anticipation which gives the high. But here's where it gets crazy. A company has figured this out. The perfect formula to hack this system. Natural dopamine works like this. You're hungry, you search for food, you find it, you get rewarded. Effort first, reward later. But apps work like watching a cricket match. Sometimes there's a boundary, sometimes there's a wicked, sometimes the singles. You never know when the excitement will come. So you just keep watching. Instagram feeds work the same way. Sometimes you see something amazing, sometimes nothing interesting. But it keeps scrolling because the legs pose could be the six year old. This randomness creates what psychologists call variable ratio reinvestment. The most addictive pattern, no more signs. Remember that demonstration we did at the beginning? You felt more engaged when we added music and gameplay, right? That wasn't an accident. The brain was getting multiple dopamine hits in anticipation that something is about to happen. Colorful gameplay catches your eye, background music, stimulates your audio cortex, fast pace editing keeps you alert. Information is still coming through. Your brain thought this is more rewarding than boring, slow contact. But here's the problem. Once your brain gets used to this level of stimulation, normal activity is day to day mundane, feels incredibly boring. Suppose reading this big of a book, too slow. Having a conversation, not stimulating enough. Watching a regular movie, even that needs to be faster now. In fact, Netflix had to introduce speed options for movies and series where you can watch content at 1.25x or 1.5x speed. And this is why you probably watch YouTube at 1.25x or 1.5x. In fact, I bet you're still watching a network 0.5x. If you buy YouTube Premium, you can speed up the video up to 4x. You're paying money to have fastest speed that... Where does it stop? This is why you need background music for simple tasks. This is why you can't just sit quietly anymore. Your dopamine system has been completely hijacked by artificial stimulation. It is designed to be more addictive than anything in nature. Now, the second reason behind BrainRot is something called attention receding. Dr. Sophie Leroy from the University of Washington discovered this phenomenon in 2009. She found that when you switch tasks, your attention doesn't fully transfer. Some of it remains residue from what you were doing before. It's like having multiple browser tabs open in your mind, all running in the background, slowing everything down. Let me show you. How serious this problem is with a really quick test. What to do? What to say? We divided people into two groups. We recited names of 10 commonly known objects to us. Very simple. All they have to do is remember those 10 names and then just repeat back to us in no particular order. But here was the twist. The group A could immediately recite the names that were being told to them. Group B had to watch two minutes of Instagram reads with full volume and then tried to remember the 10 names that we told them. Okay. Now, they will not remember anything. And guess what? The group which was watching Reels. No, no, no. Apple made a cherry, Pomegranate tea. Just one thing to say. Barely could remember two to three names. Moube, Peacock, Jams. Mango, Lion, Tiger. Nothing else. And group, we should not watch Reels. Put it remember at least 7 to 8. Apple, Banana, Mango, Cherry, Jams. Banana, Apple, Mango, Moube, Jam. Banana, Cherry, Mango, Jam. Tiger, Lion. Football, Bombay. And just for the sake of it. People who could only remember two to three names after watching two minutes of Reels. We recited the names again to them and then asked them to immediately tell us back. And we could see the score instantly doubled. Mumbai, Hockey, Cherry, Jam, Banana, Apple, Mango. So after this fun experiment, you could see how digital distraction literally eases information from your brain. This is happening to you dozens of times every single day. Every notification, every quick phone check, every task switch is dividing your attention and you're forgetting things. Your brain wasn't designed for this constant task switching. It was designed to focus on one thing at a time. Go deep and then move on. And the third and final symptom behind brain rot is something called cognitive offloading. This is basically the outsource our thinking to devices instead of using our own brains. And let me ask you something. Without looking at your phone, can you tell me your best friend's phone number or your own other number? Or can you just remember your parents phone number? Most of you probably can't. And that's the problem. We use AI for simple math like what's 15% of 2500? There's even a name for this. It's called the Google Effect. Discovered by Psychologic Betsy Sparrow from Columbia University. Our brains have learned that if information is easily accessible online, we don't bother remembering it. We just remember where to fight it. And in the Google Effect study, people who knew they could save information later, performed worse on memory test. Their brains literally decided why remember this one I can just Google it. And then you asked what's the problem here? At least I'm still getting the right answer. How does it matter if it's Google or my brain? Well that's not the problem. The problem is inability to remember anything. When you stop using your memory, it's weakens. When you stop doing mental math, you lose basic math. And when you stop navigating on your own, you lose spatial awareness like this left or this left. Like I have a friend who got completely lost in his neighborhood when his phone battery died. And at the same place where he lived for five years. Memories like a muscle, you use it or lose it. And we are collectively choosing to lose it. And these are the reason why it happens. And if I'm making a TWAXPT video, we just don't highlight a problem. We come up with solutions as well. So how do you cure brain trauma? And see, it's very easy to say. App-settling us, we are helpless. The government should interfere. It's not us. Well, your brain can be revived to get better. The problem is you. It's scientifically possible. Number one, unfollow or unsubscribe. At least one brain rod channel today. Like this channel, I found out it's literally called brain rod journey. It says brain rod and has 1.6 million subs with consistent viral views. So baby step, do at least unfollow one. And if you have small kids at home, slowly take away the TV or smartphone access. And do boning stuff with them. Play ludo, paint, draw or sketch. And uninstalling apps don't really work. You will install it quicker than you uninstalling it. Here's a small app that I use intently. So every time I open my smartphone like this, it asks the reason to open the phone. And then when you are lost in your phone, it reminds you the same reason why you unlocked your device. Small but highly effective. At times, I had no reason to enter, so I just put back my phone. And here's one way we do it tech-wise. Like we here at tech-wise, often do hashtag team, TW events. We go out to our kid games, badminton or even pickleball. And do other physical activities where all of us actually touch some grass and forget using our phones. So basically, we just need to pick up some activities and go back to basics. Go out to socialize. This helps you feel good. And slowly, it will also keep your urge to scroll in check. Let us know what are your thoughts on this solution or if you have a better one, do write down below. We'll pin the best ones. Comment section is all yours. This is Vidik signing off. See you in the next video. Pew, pew, pew.
